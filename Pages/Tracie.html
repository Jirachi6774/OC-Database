    <div class="center">
        <span class="white-text second-header">Description</span><br>
        My name as you can see is <span class="white-text">Tracie</span> <span class="japanese">(<span class="white-text">トレイシー</span>)</span>.<br>
        I'm a <span class="white-text">AI</span> (<span class="white-text">Artificial intelligence</span>) Jirachi who was made a very smart person, although that person doesn't exit anymore.<br>
        My creator died a very long time ago, I was in denial but proceeded as my code wanted me to.<br>
        I was programmed with <span class="white-text">Artificial Emotions</span>.<br>
        I also was programmed with two main and important lines of code:
        <div class="pre">
            <span class="goals">Goal One:</span> Create a new kind of Mythical Pokemon.<br>
            <span class="goals">Goal Two:</span> Observe the <i class="white-text">"Special Mythical Pokemon"</i> by sending it to Earth, a planet from a different universe.
        </div>
        These are the main goals on why I was build by my creator.<br><br>
        <span class="white-text second-header">Research</span><br>
        Research regarding myself is mostly a mystery.<br>
        I was programmed and created by my creator with the purpose on creating <span style="color: #7238a6;">Jodie</span>, my arms are able to extend themselves to reach stuff faraway.<br>
        My display is a <span class="white-text">Fancy OLED</span>, my body is made out of <span class="white-text">Stainless Steel</span> and <span class="white-text">Silver</span> and the <span class="white-text">Tags from Painted Steel</span> and as last the <span class="white-text">Streamer Engines are made from Gold together with that shape on my head</span>.<br>
        My operating system has some interesting information down below.<br>
        <div class="pre"><br><span class="second-header white-text">- Operating System Information -</span><br><br>System Name: <span class="white-text">Tracie</span><br>System Version: <span class="white-text"><span id="code1">57</span>.<span id="code2">49</span>.<span id="code3">53</span>.<span id="code4">48</span></span><br>Full System Name: <span class="white-text">Tracie</span><br>AI Version: <span class="white-text">2.6</span><br>Edition: <span class="white-text">2.0</span>
        </div>
        My programming detects that the <span class="white-text">System Version</span> numbers has a meaning but I can't seem to decipher what it could mean.<br>
        I am also the second iteration of Tracie, try to get your head around that.<br><br>
        <span class="white-text second-header">Lore</span><br>
        I am Tracie an artificial intelligence that came from another universe, I was created by a very smart person who later on after my creation died by unknown reasons and cause.<br>
        Coded with artificial emotions I was broken from within my core that powers me, despite my grief I continued on my purpose.<br>
        I continue on what my programming tells me to do, create Jodie <span class="white-text">"the Mythical Creature"</span> and observe its behavior on another planet which was called Earth.<br>
        The tests and experiments I have done with Jodie are mainly as followed:<br>
        <div class="white-text">
            Let her get eaten to see what happens with her<br>
            See her strength in action<br>
            Give her various forms to do more tests on<br>
            and Future plans!
