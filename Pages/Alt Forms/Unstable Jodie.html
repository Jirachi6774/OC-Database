		Unstable Jodie is just like the normal Jodie but full of cracks with glowing light coming out of them.<br><br>
		<span class="white-text">Research</span><br>
		Research regarding Jodie's Unstable state isn't very known yet but is enough to explain.<br>
		Unstable Jodie is the state she goes into if she is almost on exploding point to the disaster she can cause by exploding, the reason for her being able to get into this state is by being damaged while already being fainted.<br>
		The moment she would explode she turns into <span class="white-text">Collapsed Jodie</span>, this state is the catastrophic event.<br><br>
